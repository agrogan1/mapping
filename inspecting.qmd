# Inspecting Geographic Data Files {#sec-inspecting}

Often, when we open a new geographic data file, we don't know what fields of data it contains. 

It is useful to get an idea of what data our geographic data file already contains in order to know whether or not we may need to merge in other data (@sec-merging).

`names` and `head` are two useful commands for learning about new geographic data files.

As an example, I am going to use the country data from the `rnaturalearth` library (@sec-rnaturalearth).

## Data

I use `ne_countries()` to create the `mapdata` dataset as an `sf` object (@sec-sf).

```{r}
#| message: false

library(rnaturalearth) 

mapdata <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", 
                        returnclass = "sf") 

```

## names

`names` gives us the names of all of the fields of the data.

```{r}

names(mapdata)

```

## head

`head` shows us the first several rows of data.

```{r}

head(mapdata)

```
