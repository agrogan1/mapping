title: "Simple Features (`sf`)"
---

R's new default way of handling spatial data seems to be *simple features* (`sf`).

Use `library(sf)` to read, write and manipulate *simple features*.

Other forms of data such as *shapefiles* (@sec-shapefiles) often need to be read as simple features.

Mapping routines such as `ggplot` will also often want data to be in the form of *simple features*.
