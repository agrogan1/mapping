    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nShapefiles are a spatial data format originally developed by ESRI.\nShapefiles come in three major types:\n\npoints, to represent point features such as individual or agency locations. At larger scales, cities or towns might also be points.\nlines️, to represent line features such as roads, trails, or rivers.\npolygons, to represent polygon features such as outlines of cities, states, or countries."
